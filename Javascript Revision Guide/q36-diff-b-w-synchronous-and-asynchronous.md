# Q36-Diff B/W synchronous and Asynchronous

#### **Key Differences:**

| **Feature**           | **Synchronous**                                                                           | **Asynchronous**                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Order**   | Tasks execute sequentially, one after another.                                            | Tasks can start before previous ones finish, allowing for parallel execution.             |
| **Blocking**          | One task blocks the execution of others until it finishes.                                | Tasks do not block the execution of others; they run in the background.                   |
| **Use Cases**         | Simple tasks that require sequential execution, like reading a file or processing a form. | Tasks that involve waiting, such as network requests, timers, or long-running operations. |
| **Ease of Debugging** | Easier to understand and debug due to its linear nature.                                  | More complex to debug due to the non-linear execution flow.                               |
