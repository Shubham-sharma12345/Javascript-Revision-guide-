# Q 11-What is a first order function

First order functions are those that doesn't return other function as an argument and doesn't return the function as its return value.

**`const firstOrder = () => console.log("I am a first order function!");`**

or

**`function add(x, y)`**&#x20;

**`{ return x + y;`**

&#x20;**`}`**

**`console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8`**
